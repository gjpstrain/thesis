\section{Abstract}\label{abstract-adjusting-size}

\chap{chap:adjusting_opacity} provided strong evidence for the effects
of systematically varying the opacities of scatterplot points on
participants' estimates of correlation in positively correlated
scatterplots. Utilising the same function and experimental paradigm, I
show in a single experiment that systematically varying the sizes of
scatterplot points is able to bias participants' estimates of
correlation to a greater degree than manipulations that only adjust
point opacity. In a condition where point size decreases non-linearly as
a function of residual distance, correlation estimation is significantly
biased upwards to correct for the underestimation bias to a greater
degree. I discuss the implications of these findings for the mechanisms
behind both opacity and size adjustments in scatterplots in relation to
correlation estimation, and recommend techniques for those who design
with the estimation of positive correlation in mind.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-adjusting-size}

While I was successful at changing participants' perceptions of
correlation in positively correlated scatterplots in
\chap{chap:adjusting_opacity}, the extent to which these perceptions
were changed was minimal. Figure \ref{fig-estimates-by-r-e2} illustrates
how participants' mean errors in \emph{r} estimation changed as a
function of the subjective \emph{r} value. Scatterplots employing
non-linear opacity decay produced the most drastic changes in
correlation estimation, however these changes were still small, with an
effect size of Cohen's \emph{d} = 0.19. Recent evidence suggests that
with regards to altering percepts in scatterplots, changes in point size
may be more effective than changes in opacity. In a fully-reproducible,
large sample (N = 150) study, I show that systematically altering point
size using the same function is not only able to more effectively
correct for the correlation underestimation bias, but is also able to
alter the shape of the correlation estimation curve.

\subsection{Point Size and the Perception of Correlation in
Scatterplots}\label{point-size-chap5}

(miles per gallon). Additionally, the number of cylinders in the cars

vehicles with higher engine displacement and lower fuel efficiency tend
to have a greater number of engine cylinders.}

\end{figure}%

Opacity adjustments in scatterplots have been used extensively to solve
issues of overplotting and clutter in scatterplots
\cite{bertini_2004, matejka_2015}. Figure
\ref{fig-overplotting-examples} in \chap{chap:adjusting_opacity}
demonstrates this usage. Practicality also dictates that scatterplots
visualising sufficiently large datasets inherently require their points
to be smaller to prevent obfuscation of the data they portray. Aside
from being used to increase point visibility, point size changes in
scatterplots have also been employed in the creation of bubble charts;
here, the size of a scatterplot point is mapped to a third variable.
Figure~\ref{fig-bubble-chart} demonstrates this class of scatterplot
using the included \texttt{mtcars} dataset in \texttt{ggplot2}.

Despite the popularity of such charts, at the time of writing, very
little investigation into how point size affects correlation perception
in scatterplots had taken place. That which had been completed found
bias and variability in correlation perception performance to be
invariant to changes in point size \cite{rensink_2012, rensink_2014},
however these studies were low-powered considering the small effect
sizes found in the experiments described in
\chap{chap:adjusting_opacity}. From the wider literature, there is
evidence that larger points in scatterplots can bias judgements of mean
point position to a greater degree than point opacity can
\cite{hong_2022}, in what is termed the \emph{weighted average
illusion}. Outside of scatterplots and scatterplot-adjacent chart types,
there is evidence that increased size can result in faster reaction
times to peripherally presented stimuli \cite{grice_1983}, and there is
evidence that larger stimuli are associated with lower levels of spatial
certainty \cite{alais_2004}, but higher levels of salience
\cite{healey_2012}. The current experiment should therefore facilitate
discrimination between these candidate drivers of the effects observed
in a way that was not possible when manipulating opacity, as in that
case effects of salience or spatial certainty would operate in the same
direction.

\section{Hypotheses}\label{hypotheses}

Based on the findings from \chap{chap:adjusting_opacity}, and on
evidence from the wider literature described above, two hypotheses are
made:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  H1: The non-linear decay parameter, in which scatterplots points
  become smaller as they move further from the regression line, will
  result in lower mean errors in correlation estimation than for linear
  decay and standard size conditions.
\item
  H2: The use of an inverted non-linear decay parameter, in which
  scatterplot points become larger as they get further away from the
  regression line, will result in higher mean errors in correlation
  estimation than for all other conditions.
\end{itemize}

\section{Method}\label{method-e3}

\subsection{Open Research}\label{open-research-chap5}

The experiment was conducted according to the principles of open and
reproducible research. All data and code for the original paper are
maintained in a GitHub repository \footnote{https://github.com/gjpstrain/size\_and\_scatterplots}.
This repository also features an implementation of a Docker container
that enables the full recreation of the computational environment the
original paper was written in. The experiment itself is hosted on GitLab
\footnote{https://gitlab.pavlovia.org/Strain/exp\_size\_only}. The
hypotheses and analysis plans were pre-registered with the Open Science
Framework (OSF) \footnote{https://osf.io/k4gd8}, and there were non
deviations from them.

\subsection{Stimuli}\label{stimuli-e3}

The creation of stimuli in this experiment follows the same general
principles outlined in Section \ref{creating-stimuli},
\chap{chap:gen_methods}, and was performed using \texttt{ggplot2}
(version 3.4.4). As in \chap{chap:adjusting_opacity}, equation 5.1 was
used to map point residuals to size values in the two non-linear decay
conditions:

\begin{equation}
  point_{size} = 1 - b^{residual}
\end{equation}

Again, a value of \(b = 0.25\) was used. As in
\chap{chap:adjusting_opacity}, the use of this equation produces a curve
around the identity line symmetrically opposing the underestimation
curve found in previous work. Additionally, a constant of 0.2 was added
to each raw size value, and a scaling factor of 4 was utilised; these
adjustments resulted in the smallest points in the present experiment
having a width of 12 pixels on a 1920 \(\times\) 1080 pixel monitor,
which is consistent with the point size used in the experiments
described in \chap{chap:adjusting_opacity}. Examples of the stimuli used
in this experiment can be see in Figure~\ref{fig-exp3-examples-chap5}.

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{5_adjusting_size_files/figure-latex/fig-exp3-examples-chap5-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-exp3-examples-chap5}Examples of the stimuli used in
experiment 3, demonstrated with an \textit{r} value of 0.6.}

\end{figure}%

\subsection{Dot Pitch in Crowdsourced
Experiments}\label{dot-pitch-chap5}

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../supplied_graphics/screen_scale_illustration.png}

}

\caption{\label{fig-screen-scale-illustration}A mock-up of the screen
scale \cite{screenscale} task used to infer the sizes of participants'
monitors.}

\end{figure}%

When the experiments described in \chap{chap:adjusting_opacity} took
place, no method of obtaining dot pitch was implemented. Dot pitch is
defined as the distance between the dots (sub-pixels)
\cite{castellano_1992} that make up each pixel. Calculating dot pitch is
a requirement for the subsequent calculation of the physical on-screen
sizes of the scatterplot points that participants saw. In the preamble
to the current experiment, participants were asked to hold a standard
size credit/debit/ID card up to the monitor, and then to resize a
corresponding on-screen image until it matched the size of their
physical card \cite{screenscale}. These cards have a universal standard
size (ISO/IEC 7810 ID-1), which when combined with the monitor
resolution information recorded by Psychopy, and assuming a widescreen
16:9 aspect ratio, allows for the inference of dot pitch and therefore
the physical size of the points in the experiment. Mean dot pitch was
0.33mm (\(SD = 0.06\)), corresponding to a physical size on the screen
of 4.32mm for the smallest points displayed. Section \ref{results-e3}
includes analysis that takes into account the physical on-screen sizes
of scatterplot points.

\subsection{Point Visibility Testing}\label{point-visibility-testing-e3}

It is key that the manipulations used do not remove (or appear to
remove) data from scatterplots. Therefore, point visibility testing is
included in this experiment prior to the experimental items.
Participants were shown 6 scatterplots and were asked to enter in a text
box how many points were being displayed. These points were the same
size as the smallest points displayed in the experimental items. 5\% of
participants were correct on 5 out of 6 point visibility tests, while
95\% were correct on 6 out of 6. It should be noted that those
participants scoring 5/6 did not answer incorrectly, rather they did not
answer at all for a particular question, which is suggestive of a
mis-click or an initial misunderstanding of the task. Regardless, the
results of this test indicate a sufficient level of point visibility.

\subsection{Design}\label{design-e3}

A fully repeated-measures, within-participants design was employed. Each
participant saw and responded to each of the 180 scatterplots in a fully
randomised order. There were four scatterplots for each of the 45
\emph{r} values corresponding to the four levels of the size decay
condition, examples of which are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-exp3-examples-chap5}.

\subsection{Procedure}\label{procedure-e3}

Each participant viewed the PIS and provided consent through key presses
in response to consent statements. Participants were asked to provide
their age in a free text box, followed by their gender identity.
Participants then completed the 5-item Subjective Graph Literacy test
\cite{garcia_2016}, followed by the screen scale and point visibility
tasks described above. Participants were shown example of scatterplots
depicting \emph{r} values of 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, and 0.95. Section
\ref{results-e3} contains discussion of the potential effects of this
training. Following two practice trials, participants worked through the
series of 180 experimental and six attention check trials in a
randomised order. Visual masks preceded each plot.

\subsection{Participants}\label{participants-e3}

150 participants were recruited using the Prolific platform
\cite{prolific}. Normal or corrected-to-normal vision and English
fluency were required. Participants who had completed any of the
experiments described in \chap{chap:adjusting_opacity} were prevented
from participating. Data were collected from 164 participants. 14 failed
more than 2 out of 6 attention check questions, and, as per the
pre-registration, had their submissions rejected from the study. The
data from the remaining 150 participants were included in the full
analysis (72 male, 75 female, and 3 non-binary). Participants' mean age
was 29.56 (\emph{SD} = 8.54). Mean graph literacy score was 21.77
(\emph{SD} = 4.29). The average time taken to complete the experiment
was 39 minutes (SD = 14 minutes).

\section{Results}\label{results-e3}

To investigate the effects of point size adjustments on participants'
estimates of correlation, a linear mixed effects model was built whereby
the point size condition is a predictor for the difference between
objective \emph{r} values for each plot and participants' estimates of
\emph{r}. This model has random intercepts for participants and items. A
likelihood ratio test revealed that the model including size decay
function as a fixed effect explained significantly more variance than
the null model (\(\chi^2\)(3) = 3,508.84, \emph{p} \textless{} .001).
Figure~\ref{fig-e3-estimates} shows the mean errors in correlation
estimation for each size decay condition, along with 95\% confidence
intervals.

\addlinespace

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

}

\end{table}%

This effect was driven by significant differences between means of
correlation estimation error between all conditions. Statistical tests
for contrasts were performed using the \texttt{emmeans} package
\cite{lenth_2024}, and are shown in Table~\ref{tbl-contrasts-e3}. To
test whether the observed results could be explained by differences in
participants' levels of graph literacy, an additional model was built.
This model is identical to the experimental model, but also includes
graph literacy as a fixed effect. Including graph literacy as a fixed
effect explained no additional variance (\(\chi^2\)(1) = 0.16, \emph{p}
= .690), indicating that the differences observed in participants'
correlation estimation performance were not as a result of differences
in levels of graph literacy.

While participants performed well on the point visibility task, another
facet of using a larger or smaller monitor with a lower or higher
resolution could have affected estimates of correlation. Comparing a
model including the dot pitch of participants' monitors to the
experimental model revealed a significant main effect (\(\chi^2\)(1) =
4.65, \emph{p} = .031). There was no interaction between size decay
condition and dot pitch; a 0.1mm decrease in dot pitch resulted in
correlation estimates decreasing by .03. Given the low range of dot
pitches gathered from participants (0.13mm to 0.63mm), the effect is not
substantial enough to warrant further discussion.

\end{figure}%

As in \chap{chap:adjusting_opacity}, an approximation of Cohen's
\emph{d} was calculated between the reference level (here labelled
``Standard Size'') and all other levels of the size decay factor. These
statistics can be seen in Table~\ref{tbl-efs-e3} along with descriptive
statistics for all levels. The largest observed effect size is between
the standard size and non-linear decay conditions (\emph{d} = 0.64), and
is medium. This is a marked improvement on the non-linear opacity decay
condition from experiment 2, \chap{chap:adjusting_opacity}, where the
effect size observed was \emph{d} = 0.19.
Figure~\ref{fig-estimates-by-r-e3} plots the effects of each size decay
manipulation separately for each \emph{r} value used. Points represent
means of estimation error for each \emph{r} value, with standard
deviations of error shown as error bars. The dashed horizontal line
represents hypothetical perfect estimation. Expectedly, while
participants still underestimated \emph{r} in all conditions, the
non-linear size decay condition provided the most promising correction
to date; the average estimation error is approaching a flat line (see
the left-most plot in Figure~\ref{fig-estimates-by-r-e3}).

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion-e3}

Participants' errors in correlation estimation were significantly lower
in the non-linear size decay condition (see
Figure~\ref{fig-estimates-by-r-e3}) compared to all other conditions.
This finding provides support for the first hypothesis. Conversely, no
support was found for the second hypothesis, that estimates would be
least accurate in the inverted non-linear size decay condition. Errors
in this condition were significantly higher than for the other two decay
conditions, but were significantly lower than the errors that were
observed for the standard size condition.

\subsection{Increased Correlation Estimation
Accuracy}\label{increased-correlation-estimation-accuracy}

The mean error in correlation estimation for the non-linear size decay
condition in this experiment was .025, while for the equivalent opacity
decay condition described in experiment 2 (see
\chap{chap:adjusting_opacity}) was .086. This finding, along with the
significantly higher Cohen's \emph{d} effect size reported in this
experiment compared to experiment 2 for the non-linear decay conditions
(0.86 vs.~0.19), provides evidence that point size is a stronger
encoding channel for the manipulation of perceived correlation than
point opacity. If these effects are being driven by the lower salience
of more exterior points, the fact that a larger effect of point size has
been reported is congruent with research showing clear influences of
stimulus size on object salience and perceptual weighting
\cite{grice_1983, hong_2022, healey_2012}. The present results therefore
provide support for point salience/perceptual weighting being a key
driver of the effects observed; lower point salience brought on by
reduced point size in the exterior of the scatterplot reduces the
perceived width of the distribution of data points around the regression
line, biasing estimates of correlation upwards and leading to a higher
degree of accuracy. Other candidate mechanisms do exist; similar results
would be expected if a feature-based attentional bias was responsible
\cite{sun_2016, hong_2022}; the current methodology does not allow for
distinguishing between these explanations, and it may be that both are
partially responsible.

The lack of support for the second hypothesis is surprising, and
suggests that point salience and perceived distributional width do not
form the whole story. There is evidence that larger stimuli exhibit
greater levels of spatial uncertainty \cite{alais_2004}, and it is
possible that this uncertainty results in a perceptual under-weighting
of the contribution of these points during correlation estimation. This
is consistent with previous work \cite{warren_2002, warren_2004}
suggesting that the brain may make robust statistical use of
visuo-spatial information. These mechanisms act to downweight the
influence of less reliable information (in this case the higher spatial
uncertainty of larger exterior points) on subsequent perceptual
estimates. In the present experiment, this resulted in participants
making more accurate estimates of correlation in the inverted decay
condition compared to the standard size condition. It was suggested in
\chap{chap:adjusting_opacity} that inverted opacity manipulations may be
employed to correct for the \emph{overestimation} of correlation
observed with negatively correlation scatterplots \cite{sher_2017};
findings here indicate that using an inverted size decay function in
this way may not be appropriate.

\subsection{Constant Correlation Estimation
Precision}\label{constant-correlation-estimation-precision}

Unlike the experiments described in \chap{chap:adjusting_opacity}, in
which standard deviations of correlation estimation errors generally
became smaller as the actual \emph{r} value increased, distributions of
standard deviations here remained mostly constant. This was unexpected,
as previous work
\cite{rensink_2010, rensink_2012, rensink_2014, rensink_2017} routinely
finds precision in \emph{r} estimation to increase with the objective
\emph{r} value. This finding may be related to the nature of the stimuli
in the current study. At high values of \emph{r} there is a large amount
of overlap between points in the non-linear, non-linear inverted, and
linear size decay conditions. This overlap may blur the percept and
account for the absence of this effect, however cannot account for these
findings with regards to the standard size condition. Aside from the
inverted non-linear decay condition in \chap{chap:adjusting_opacity},
the finding that precision increased with \emph{r} was robust. Its
absence here is curious given that the standard size decay condition
here is identical to the full opacity condition in that chapter. Relying
on relative judgements means the interplay between scatterplots with
different visual features must be accounted for within a particular
experiment. The stimuli as \emph{r} approaches 1 in the current study
exhibit greater levels of visual variance than the stimuli in
experiments 1 and 2 (see \chap{chap:adjusting_opacity}), which may
explain the lack of increased precision here. Further testing is
required for a more concrete explanation.

Ultimately, my aim is to provide tools for the design of visualisations
more suited for the tasks they are intended to support. When that task
is the perception of positive correlation, the use of the non-linear
size decay condition described here is recommended. For other
scatterplot tasks, such as cluster separation or numerosity perception,
or other chart types, the use of the size manipulation may in fact be a
hindrance.

\subsection{Training}\label{training-e3}

Before beginning the experimental trials, participants viewed plots
depicting \emph{r} = 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, and 0.95 for a minimum of 8 seconds.
Comparing a model including session half as a fixed effect with the
origin experimental model revealed no significant effect (\(\chi^2\)(1)
= 1.06, \emph{p} = 0.30), suggesting that having more recently viewed
the example plots did not have an effect on participants' performance.

\subsection{Limitations}\label{limitations-e3}

Despite confirming a method of obtaining dot pitch, no method of
obtaining head-to-monitor distances is available. This, along with the
comparative correlation judgements collected, prevents concrete
psychophysical conclusions from being made. Instead, the experimental
paradigm allows for findings that are rigorous to different viewing
contexts and are of particular importance for the HCI and visualisation
design audiences. It may be that a high level perceptual phenomenon is
responsible for the effects seen here; investigating this is beyond the
scope of the current study and does not negate the findings. There is
also the potential for misinterpretation of the scatterplots presented
in the current study, especially given their similarity in form, but not
purpose, to bubble charts.

\subsection{Future Work}\label{future-work-e3}

Evidence has been found for robust effects of varying point opacity and
point size on correlation estimation in positively correlated
scatterplots. There are different effects of changing these visual
features, and these effects are also partially dependent on the
objective \emph{r} value in the scatterplot. Future work should
investigate the combination of these visual manipulations as they
pertain to correlation estimation.

Additionally, future qualitative work is required to investigate whether
the modified scatterplots presented result in misinterpretation or a
decrease in the levels of trust people place in data visualisations.

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion-chap5}

I conducted a single experiment, in which points on scatterplots had
their sizes systematically changed according to their distance from the
regression line. The equation relating point size to residual distance
was identical to that used in \chap{chap:adjusting_opacity}, with the
addition of a scaling factor and constant to provide parity between the
smallest points in the previous experiment and those in the current.
Additionally, I tested the visibility of the smallest points used to
ensure that no data were functionally removed, as well as collecting the
sizes and resolutions of participants' monitors. I found evidence that
reducing the size of scatterplot points as a function of residual error
using a non-linear equation not only produced significantly more
accurate estimates of positive correlation, but also subtly changed the
fundamental shape of the estimation curve in a way not previously
reported. Unlike the inverted opacity decay function used in
\chap{chap:adjusting_opacity}, the inverted size decay function here did
not produce the least accurate estimates of correlation; these were
found when participants viewed the ``standard size'' plot devoid of a
size manipulation. Taken together, these results suggest a greater
potential for manipulating correlation estimates when using point size
compared to point opacity.
