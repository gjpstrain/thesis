\section{Abstract}\label{abstract-adjusting-opacity}

Scatterplots are common data visualisations utilised for communication
with experts and lay people alike. Despite being widely studied, it is
common for people to underestimate the level of correlation displayed in
them. The weight of evidence points toward changes in the opacities of
scatterplot points being unable to change perceptions of correlation,
however this was not tested rigorously using systematic adjustments.
Drawing on evidence that the shape of a scatterplot's point cloud may
drive correlation perception, I conducted exploratory work addressing
this underestimation bias. In two experiments (total \emph{N} = 300),
evidence is provided that changing the opacities of scatterplot points
\emph{can} have small effects on participants' performance on a
correlation estimation task. The systematic adjustment of point opacity
as a function of residual distance is able to alter estimates
sufficiently to correct for the underestimation bias. In this chapter, I
also present an early pilot study that was ultimately not included in
any published works.

\section{Preface: Learning From an Early Pilot Study}\label{pilot-study}

The research proposal that kickstarted this project in 2021 set out a
plan to investigate the perception of correlation in scatterplots as a
function of screen size. This proprosal is included in the supplemental
materials. This was prompted by recent research demonstrating consistent
perceptual biases in scatterplots due to geometric scaling
\cite{wei_2020}, the increasing prevalence of data visualisations in lay
people's daily lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the increasing
adoption of wearable devices. The first experiment conducted therefore
examined how perceptions of correlation changed according to the size of
a scatterplot. Additionally, a very early version of the opacity decay
factor from experiment 2 was included, however the implementation of
this factor was immature. In experiment 2 onwards, if a scatterplot
point resided in a particular place, it would always have the same
opacity or size. In the pilot study, the code that set the opacity of
each point always scaled the opacity values such that the point with the
highest residual had the lowest possible opacity, and vice versa,
resulting in the plots seen in Figure~\ref{fig-pilot-study-examples}.

\begin{figure}

}

\caption{\label{fig-pilot-study-examples}Examples of the experimental
stimuli used in the pilot study (opacity decay factor). On the left, the
opacity decay function is visible. Note the linear scaling used.}

\end{figure}%

This provided no consistency between different experimental stimuli,
making it difficult to comment on the effects of changing levels of
opacity in various parts of a plot on correlation estimation. This was
later addressed by hardcoding residual size to a specific value of
opacity or size. The pilot also suffered extensively from poor data
quality. Of the 260 participants tested, data from only 118 was included
in the final analyses due to failed attention checks. It is for this
reason that the pre-screen requirements detailed in Section
\ref{recruitment} were implemented.

Participants viewed 180 experimental plots in a 3x2 factorial design.
The first independent variable, plot size, had three levels, 63\%,
100\%, and 252\% scales. The second was the presence or absence of the
opacity decay function (see Figure~\ref{fig-pilot-study-examples}). I
aimed to recruit 150 participants, but stopped after 118 due to data
quality issues. Nevertheless, the results provided were crucial in
informing the future direction of the research project. I present these
results in brief below.

\subsection{Pilot Study: Results}\label{pilot-study-results}

To investigate the effects of plot size and the presence or absence of
an opacity decay manipulation on participants' estimates of correlation,
a linear mixed effects model was built whereby participants' errors in
correlation estimation were predicted by plot size and the presence or
absence of the opacity decay function. This model features random
intercepts for participants and items, as well as random slopes for both
participants and items relevant to the presence or absence of the
opacity decay function. A likelihood ratio test between the experimental
model and a null model with the fixed effects removed revealed that the
experimental model explained significantly more variance than the null
(\(\chi^2\)(3) = 26.38, \emph{p} \textless{} .001). There was no
interaction between plot size and the presence or absence of the opacity
decay function. The \textbf{emmeans} \cite{lenth_2024} package was used
to explore estimated marginal means (see Table~\ref{tbl-emmeans-pilot})
and contrasts (see Table~\ref{tbl-contrasts-pilot}) separately for each
factor.

\subsection{Pilot Study: Discussion}\label{pilot-study-discussion}

For the factor of plot size, the effect observed was driven by
significant differences in correlation estimation error between large
and small plots. Participants estimated more accurately when the plot
was large and when the decay function was present. Participants still
underestimated correlation in all conditions. The finding that
estimation error was lower for larger plots is in line with previous
evidence that geometrically scaling a scatterplot up can increase
perceptions of the strength of the correlation displayed
\cite{wei_2020}. Despite the statistical significance of this finding,
we elected at this point to abandon the plot size factor due to the
extremely small effect (see Table~\ref{tbl-emmeans-pilot}) and lack of
novelty.

The impact of even an immature point opacity decay function on
correlation estimation was a novel finding that we felt deserved
further, and more rigorous, study. Its implementation was based on
findings that changing the opacities of scatterplot points could bias
estimates of means \cite{hong_2022}, and on limited evidence for the
perception of correlation being based on the perceived width of a
probability distribution represented by the arrangement of scatterplot
points. I did not foresee the decay function, being novel, having a
greater effect on correlation estimation than size. Once evidence had
been found that changing the opacity of points in scatterplots could
have effects on correlation estimation, in opposition to previous
research \cite{rensink_2012, rensink_2014}, the door was opened for a
rigorous investigation into how this worked and how it could be used
systematically to correct for the historic underestimation bias.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-adjusting-opacity}

Findings from the pilot study suggest that changing the opacities of
points in scatterplots is able to change participants' estimates of the
correlation being displayed. The effect found in that study was too
small to make a real difference with regards to correcting for the
underestimation bias, and does not provide information on \emph{how}
changing opacity might change the percept (only that \emph{it does}).
Failing to understand the ways in which opacity is able to change the
perception of correlation prevents future work from tuning what was a
small effect in the pilot study into something with real potential for
producing more perceptually optimised scatterplots.

\subsection{Overview}\label{overview-adjusting-opacity}

In two experiments, the opacities of points in scatterplots were
manipulated while participants were asked to make judgements of
correlation. In the first, point opacity is changed in a uniform manner,
while in the second, point opacity is systematically altered as a
function of the size of a particular point's residual. By comparing
participants' performance on a correlation estimation task for
data-identical scatterplots that vary only in the opacities of their
points, it is demonstrated that; lower global point opacity results in
greater errors in the estimation of positive correlation (experiment 1);
and lowering point opacity as a function of the size of a point's
residual is able to bias estimates of positive correlation upwards to
partially correct for a historic underestimation bias.

\section{Related Work}\label{related-work-adjusting-opacity}

\subsection{Transparency, Contrast, Opacity, and Formal
Definitions}\label{transparency-contrast-opacity-and-formal-definitions}

The original paper that this chapter is based on is titled ``The Effects
of Contrast on Correlation Perception in Scatterplots''. In response to
reviewer comments to the paper that forms Chapter 6, the term
``contrast'' was changed to ``opacity''. In order to maintain
consistency throughout this thesis, the more up-to-date wording
(opacity) is used, although I discuss the issue of terminology below.

Adjusting the opacity of points in scatterplots is an established
technique used to address issues of overplotting or clutter
\cite{bertini_2004, matejka_2015}, in which scatterplots with large
numbers of data points suffer from visibility issues caused by excessive
point density. Lowering the opacity of all scatterplot points using
alpha blending \cite{few_2008} addresses this, and makes data trends and
distributions easier to see and interpret for the reader.
Figure~\ref{fig-overplotting-examples} demonstrates the impact of
lowering global point opacity in a scatterplot with a very high number
of data points.

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{4_adjusting_opacity_files/figure-latex/fig-overplotting-examples-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-overplotting-examples}Adjusting point opacity to
address overplotting. Contrast between the points and the background is
full (alpha = 1, full opacity points, Left) or low (alpha = .1, low
opacity points, Right). The dataset used has 20,000 points.}

\end{figure}%

Lowering opacity leads to a reduction of the contrast of isolated points
with the background, and for regions with overlapping points, colour
intensities are summed. The stimuli used in the experiments throughout
this chapter had 128 small points, meaning the majority of points were
clearly visible at all times. For this reason, the effects of point
overlap were not taken into account when designing and analysing the
experiments described here. Due to this, the approach to opacity
described in this chapter would not be useful when dealing with much
larger datasets where clutter becomes an issue.

The \textbf{ggplot2} \cite{wickham_2016} package was used in R to create
stimuli for this experiment. This package uses an alpha parameter to set
point opacity. Alpha here refers to the level of linear interpolation
\cite{stone_2008} between foreground and background pixel values; alpha
values of 0 (full transparency) and 1 (full opacity) result in no
interpolation and rendering of either the background or foreground pixel
values respectively. Alpha values between 0 and 1 correspond to
different ratios of interpolation, and are illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig-alpha-examples}.

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{4_adjusting_opacity_files/figure-latex/fig-alpha-examples-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-alpha-examples}The relationship between alpha values
and rendered point opacity. Higher alpha values result in greater
contrast between the foreground (scatterplot point) and background. When
alpha = 0, the foreground is ignored and the background is rendered.}

\end{figure}%

Definitions of contrast, opacity, and transparency are fuzzy. Often,
different works will use the terms interchangeably. As mentioned above,
I initially elected to use the term ``contrast'', given the
fundamentality of contrast as a feature of human visual perception
\cite{ginsburg_2003}, however later reviewer comments prompted the
change to ``opacity''. Nevertheless, we can consider \emph{opacity} as
it is used here to be shorthand for ``the contrast between foreground
and background objects'', as visually, these concepts are the same.
There are numerous psychophysical definitions of perceived contrast
\cite{zuffi_2007} based on what is being presented, for example, models
that take into account visibility limits (CIELAB lightness), or contrast
in periodic patterns such as sinusoidal gratings (Michelson's contrast).
The common thread running through these definitions is the use of a
ratio between target and background luminances. The experiments
described here take place online, with participants completing
experiments on their personal laptop or desktop computers. Due to this,
the experimenter has no control over the exact luminances of stimuli,
only over the relative luminance between targets (scatterplot points)
and backgrounds. Given my interest in relative differences in
correlation perception averaged over a series of 180 single-plot trials,
this lack of control over the exact nature of the stimuli was not
problematic. It does mean that reporting the exact luminance values
would be pointless however, so where a value for opacity is referred to
in this chapter and beyond, it is the alpha value specified by
\textbf{ggplot2}.

\subsection{Effects of Point Opacity on Correlation
Estimation}\label{effects-of-point-opacity-on-correlation-estimation}

Despite the popularity of adjusting opacity to address overplotting
issues, little investigation had taken place into the effects of
reducing point opacity on people's perceptions of correlation. In 2012,
Rensink \cite{rensink_2012} found correlation perception to be invariant
to changes in point opacity, although this work took place with only
small sample sizes (n = 12), and using only bisection/JND methodologies.

Changing the contrast between a stimulus and its background (lowering
its opacity) effectively reduces the strength of its signal. A likely
consequence of this is greater levels of uncertainty in aspects of that
stimulus, for example, the locations of points in scatterplots.
Consequently, one might anticipate that increased uncertainty could lead
to altered perceptions of correlation and/or the presence of greater
levels of noise in correlation estimates due to effects on the perceived
position of points within a scatterplot point cloud. While there is
evidence \cite{wehrhahn_1990} that perception of stimulus position
becomes exponentially worse as contrast is reduced (as measured by
vernier acuity tasks), this is only true for a narrow range of low
contrast stimuli just above the detection threshold. For stimuli that
feature higher contrasts between them and their backgrounds, vernier
acuity appears robust to such changes. Nevertheless, there is evidence
that other perceptual estimates become more uncertain with reduced
contrast, such as speed perception \cite{champion_2017}. With this in
mind, I argue that the effects of stimulus opacity on perceived
correlation in scatterplots warrants further investigation.

In 2022 \cite{hong_2022}, Hong et al.~used point opacity and size to
encode a third variable in trivariate scatterplots, while asking
participants to judge the average position of all the points displayed.
It was found that participants' estimates of average point position were
biased towards areas of larger or darker points; this was termed the
\emph{weighted average illusion}. Together with evidence that darker
(more opaque) and larger points are more salient \cite{healey_2011}, the
implication I took from this work was that I could use point opacity to
systematically lower the salience of the points representing the widest
parts of the probability distribution; if participants promptly
perceived a narrower distribution, I expected this to be able to (at
least partially) correct for the underestimation bias.

One way to correct for an underestimation of correlation in scatterplots
would be to simply remove outer data points until correlation perception
is aligned with the actual correlation value. However, this would
necessitate hiding data and thus changing the information presented to
the viewer. An alternative approach is to manipulate the opacity of only
some of the points; it would seem most sensible to do so for the points
that are more extreme relative to the underlying regression line. In the
present study these questions are explored in two online experiments
with large sample sizes. In the first, the effects of point opacity over
the entire scatterplot on correlation estimates is investigated. In the
second experiment we examine how changing contrast as a function of
distance to the regression line affects perceived correlation. To
pre-empt our results we find clear effects of both manipulations.

\section{General Methods}\label{shared-methods-adjusting-opacity}

The experiments described in this chapter share multiple aspects of
their procedures. Both experiments were built using PsychoPy
\cite{peirce_2019} and are hosted on pavlovia.org. Both use 1-factor,
4-level designs. Ethical approval for both experiments was granted by
the University of Manchester's Computer Science Departmental Panel (Ref:
2022-14660-24397). In each experiment, participants were shown the
respective Participant Information Sheet (henceforth PIS) and provided
consent through key presses in response to consent statements.
Participants were asked to provide their age and gender identity, after
which they completed the 5-item Subjective Graph Literacy test described
by Garcia-Retamero et al.~\cite{garcia_2016} and discussed in Section
\ref{graph-literacy-lit-review} of the literature review. Early piloting
with a graduate student in humanities suggested the potential for
participants to be unfamiliar with the visual nature of different values
of Pearson's \emph{r}. Participants were therefore shown examples of
\emph{r} = 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, and 0.95 (see
Figure~\ref{fig-training-slide-adjusting-opacity}); a discussion of the
effects of this training is provided in Section
\ref{training-adjusting-opacity}. Participants were given two practice
trials to familiarise themselves with the response slider.

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../supplied_graphics/example-plots.png}

}

\caption{\label{fig-training-slide-adjusting-opacity}Participants viewed
these plots for at least eight seconds before being allowed to continue
to the practice trials.}

\end{figure}%

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../supplied_graphics/visual_mask.png}

}

\caption{\label{fig-mask-adjusting-opacity}An example of a visual mask
displayed for 2.5 seconds before each experimental trial.}

\end{figure}%

Each trial was preceded by text that either told the participant:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Please look at the following plot and use the slider to estimate the
  correlation (n = 180).
\item
  Please IGNORE the correlation displayed and set the slider to 1 (n =
  3) or 0 (n = 3).
\end{itemize}

The latter instructions were attention checks, and were formatted with
red text to increase their visibility. Each experimental trial was
preceded by a visual mask (see Figure~\ref{fig-mask-adjusting-opacity})
that was displayed for 2.5 seconds. Participants were instructed to make
their judgements as quickly and accurately as possible, but there was no
time limit per trial. Both experiments described here use a fully
repeated-measures, within-participants design. Participants saw all 180
experimental items, corresponding to \textasciitilde27,000 individual
judgements per experiment, in a fully randomised order.

Both experiments were conducted according to principles of open and
reproducible research. All data and analysis code for the origin paper
is available on GitHub \footnote{https://github.com/gjpstrain/contrast\_and\_scatterplots}.
Experiment 1 \footnote{https://gitlab.pavlovia.org/Strain/exp\_uniform\_adjustments}
and 2 \footnote{https://gitlab.pavlovia.org/Strain/exp\_spatially\_dependent}
are hosted on Pavlovia.org, while the Open Science Framework hosts
pre-registrations \footnote{Experiment 1 - https://osf.io/tuexh.
  Experiment 2 - https://osf.io/6f5ev}. It is important to note at this
point that experiment 2 was conducted prior to experiment 1; when the
original paper was written, the order of presentation of the experiments
was swapped to make the narrative more cohesive. I preserve this order
in the present chapter.

\section{Experiment 1: Uniform Opacity
Adjustments}\label{experiment-1-uniform-opacity-adjustments}

\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction-adjusting-opacity-e1}

Owing to the robust effects of altering stimulus opacity on perception
described above \cite{wehrhahn_1990, champion_2017}, it was hypothesised
that there would be a greater spread of estimates of correlation for
plots with lower global opacity compared to higher opacity plots.

\subsection{Method}\label{methods-adjusting-opacity-e1}

\subsubsection{Participants}\label{participants}

150 participants were recruited using the Prolific platform
\cite{prolific}. Normal to corrected-to-normal vision and English
fluency were required. Participants who had completed the pre-study were
prevented from participating. Data were collected from 158 participants.
8 failed more than 2 out of 6 attention check questions, and, as per the
pre-registration, had their submissions rejected from the study. The
data from the remaining 150 participants were included in the full
analysis (50.67\% male, 47.33 \% female, and 1.33\% non-binary).
Participants' mean age was 28.29 (\emph{SD} = 8.59). Mean graph literacy
score was 21.79 (\emph{SD} = 4.47). The mean time taken to complete the
experiment was 33 minutes (SD = 10 minutes).

\subsubsection{Design}\label{design}

For each of the 45 \emph{r} values, there were four versions of each
plot corresponding to the four levels of point opacity. Examples of each
of these can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig-exp1-examples-chap4},
demonstrated with an \emph{r} value of 0.6.

\begin{figure}

\centering{

experiment 1, demonstrated with an \textit{r} value of 0.6. Here,
``opacity'' refers to the alpha value used by ggplot.}

\end{figure}%

\subsection{Analysis}\label{analysis-adjusting-opacity-e1}

To investigate the effects of opacity condition on participants'
estimates of correlation, a linear mixed effects model was built whereby
opacity condition is a predictor for the difference between objective
\emph{r} values for each plot and participants' estimates of \emph{r}.
This model has random intercepts for items and participants. A
likelihood ratio test revealed that the mode including global opacity as
a fixed effect explained significantly more variance than a null model
(\(\chi^2\)(3) = 223.13, \emph{p} \textless{} .001).
Figure~\ref{fig-e1-estimates} shows the mean errors in correlation
estimation for each opacity condition, along with 95\% confidence
intervals.

(alpha = 0.25) & -6.631 & <0.001\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

}

\end{table}%

This effect was driven by significant difference between means of
correlation estimation error between all conditions bar high and full
opacity. Statistical tests for contrasts were performed using the
\textbf{emmeans} package \cite{lenth_2024}, and are shown in
Table~\ref{tbl-contrasts-e1}. To test whether the observed results could
be explained by difference in participants' levels of graph literacy, an
additional model was built. This model is identical to the experimental
model, but also includes graph literacy as a fixed effect. Including
graph literacy as a fixed effect explained no additional variance
(\(\chi^2\)(1) = .002, \emph{p} = .962), indicating that the differences
observed in participants' correlation estimation performance were not as
a result of differences in levels of graph literacy.

\begin{table}

Low Opacity (alpha = 0.25) & 0.16\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

}

\end{table}%

A function from the now archived \textbf{EMAtools} package
\cite{ematools} was used to calculate an approximation of Cohen's
\emph{d} between the reference level (full contrast, alpha = 1.0) and
each other level of the opacity factor. These statistics can be seen in
Table~\ref{tbl-efs-e1}. The largest effect size observed (\emph{d}
\textasciitilde{} 0.16) is between the low and full opacity conditions,
and is small. This was unsurprising given the lack of previously
reported effects on correlation perception of global point opacity
\cite{rensink_2012}.

For each of the 45 \emph{r} values in experiment 2, there were four

of each of these can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig-exp2-examples-chap4},
demonstrated with an \emph{r} value of 0.6.

estimation for each opacity decay function condition, along with 95\%
confidence intervals.

The effect seen in experiment 2 was driven by significant differences in
means of correlation estimation error between all levels of opacity
decay function condition bar full opacity and linear decay. Statistical
testing for contrasts was performed using the \textbf{emmeans} package
\cite{lenth_2024}, and are shown in Table~\ref{tbl-contrasts-e2}. To
test whether the observed results could be explained by differences in
graph literacy, a model including participants' graph literacy scores as
a fixed effect was built. Including graph literacy as a fixed effect
again explained no additional variance (\(\chi^2\)(1) = .242, \emph{p} =
.623).

Approximated Cohen's \emph{d} effect sizes between the baseline (global
full opacity) and each other condition can be seen in
Table~\ref{tbl-efs-e2}. The largest effect size observed
(\textasciitilde0.23 between full opacity and inverted decay conditions)
is small to moderate, and the effect size between the baseline and the
non-linear decay condition (\textasciitilde0.19) is small.
