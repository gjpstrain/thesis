Normal to corrected-to-normal vision and English fluency were required.
Participants who had completed any of the experiments described in
\chap{chap:adjusting_opacity} or \chap{chap:adjusting_size} were
prevented from participating. Data were collected from 158 participants.
8 failed more than 2 out of 6 attention check questions, and, as per the
pre-registration, had their submissions rejected from the study. The
data from the remaining 150 participants were included in the full
analysis (51\% male, 49 \% female, and 1\% non-binary). Participants'
mean age was 30.65 (\emph{SD} = 8.64). Mean graph literacy score was
22.49 (\emph{SD} = 3.55). The average time taken to complete the
experiment was 37 minutes (SD = 12.3 minutes).
