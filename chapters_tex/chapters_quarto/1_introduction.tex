\section{Included Publications}\label{included-publications}

The research described in chapters 4, 5, 6, and 7 in this thesis is
adapted from earlier publications, the last of which under review as of
writing. To avoid repetition, information and discussion that would be
repeated has been consolidated into the literature review and general
methodology chapters. \emph{Gabriel Strain} is the primary author of all
included papers.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{The Effects of Contrast on Correlation Perception in
  Scatterplots} \cite{strain_2023} is reproduced in
  \chap{chap:adjusting_opacity}. Sections
  \ref{methods-adjusting-opacity-e1},
  \ref{methods-adjusting-opacity-e2},
  \ref{analysis-adjusting-opacity-e1},
  \ref{analysis-adjusting-opacity-e2},
  \ref{discussion-adjusting-opacity-e1},
  \ref{discussion-adjusting-opacity-e2},
  and\ref{general-discussion-adjusting-opacity} contain minimally
  altered parts of the published article.
\item
  \emph{Adjusting Point Size to Facilitate More Accurate Correlation
  Perception in Scatterplots} \cite{strain_2024} is reproduced in
  \chap{chap:adjusting_size}. Sections \ref{methods-adjusting-size},
  \ref{analysis-adjusting-size}, \ref{discussion-adjusting-size}, and
  \ref{general-discussion-adjusting-size} contain minimally altered
  parts of the published article.
\item
  \emph{Effects of Point Size and Opacity Adjustments in Scatterplots}
  \cite{strain_2024b} is reproduced in
  \chap{chap:interactions_opacity_size}. Sections
  \ref{methods-interactions}, \ref{analysis-interactions},
  \ref{discussion-interactions}, and
  \ref{general-discussion-interactions} contain minimally altered parts
  of the published article.
\item
  \emph{Effects of Alternative Scatterplot Designs on Belief}
  (\emph{under review}) is reproduced in \chap{chap:belief_change}.
  Sections \ref{beliefs-pre-study}, \ref{methods-beliefs-main},
  \ref{analysis-beliefs-main}, \ref{discussion-beliefs-main}, and
