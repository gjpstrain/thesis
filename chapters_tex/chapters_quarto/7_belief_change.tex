\section{Abstract}\label{abstract-beliefs}

\chap{chap:adjusting_opacity}, \chap{chap:adjusting_size}, and
\chap{chap:interactions_opacity_size} show through four experiments that
point opacity and size changes can have powerful effects on
participants' estimates of correlation in positively correlated
scatterplots. In \chap{chap:adjusting_opacity}, global and
spatially-dependent adjustments in point opacity were employed, and a
small, but statistically significant level of correction for a historic
underestimation bias of positive correlation was found.
Spatially-dependent adjustment of point size, in which size is reduced
as a function of residual error, was found in \chap{chap:adjusting_size}
to produce much stronger effects on estimates of correlation; the
non-linear decay function used in that experiment produced higher levels
of correction and resulted in highly accurate correlation estimates. In
\chap{chap:interactions_opacity_size}, these point opacity and size
manipulations were combined. Their combination was found to produce
stronger effects than would be expected if they were linearly additive.
While my efforts at correcting for the underestimation bias were
successful, my work has not yet attempted to investigate whether any of
the techniques developed in this thesis may be used to change people's
cognitions about data. Therefore, for my final experimental chapter, I
show that scatterplot manipulations that are able to correct for a
historic correlation underestimation bias are also able to induce
stronger levels of belief change in viewers compared to conventional
plots showing identical data. In a pre-study and main experiment, I
provide evidence that adjusting visual features in scatterplots can go
beyond simple perceptual effects to influence beliefs about information
from trusted news sources.

\section{Pre-Study: Investigating Beliefs About Relatedness
Statements}\label{beliefs-e5a}

\subsection{Introduction}\label{intro-e5a}

\subsection{Method}\label{method-e5a}

\subsubsection{Design}\label{design-e5a}

Each participant saw all survey items (see Appendix A), along with the
six attention check items, in a fully randomised order. All experimental
code, materials, and instructions are hosted on GitLab \footnote{https://gitlab.pavlovia.org/Strain/beliefs\_scatterplots\_pretest}.

\subsubsection{Procedure}\label{procedure-e5a}

Participants viewed the PIS and were asked to provide through key
presses in response to consent statements. They were prompted to provide
their age in a free text box and their gender identity. Participants
were told that they would be asked to read statements about the
relatedness between a pair of variables, after which they would be asked
to answer some questions. To familiarise themselves with the sliders
used to collect responses, they were asked to complete a practice trial
in response to the statement: ``As participation in online experiments
increases, society becomes happier''. Following each statement, a pair
of Likert scales were presented labelled ``Statement Emotionality'' and
``Strength of Relatedness; these scales were identical to those used by
myself a co-author in Section \ref{beliefs-e5a}.

\subsubsection{Participants}\label{participants-e5a}

100 participants were recruited using the Prolific platform
\cite{prolific}. English fluency and UK residency were required for
participation, as the main experiment relied on familiarity with data
visualisations from a popular British news source. In addition to 25
experimental items, six attention check items were included that
instructed participants to ignore the statement and provide specific
answers to the Likert scale sliders. No participants failed more than 2
out of 6 attention check items, and therefore data from all 100 were
included in the full analysis (52 male and 48 female). Participants'
mean age was 41.1 (\emph{SD} = 12.3). The average time taken to complete
the survey was 14.2 minutes (\emph{SD} = 2.9 minutes).

\subsection{Results}\label{results-e5a}

As before, the \texttt{irr} package \cite{irr} to measure interrater
agreement on statement emotional valence and strength of relatedness for
the 25 experimental items. This analysis revealed that participants
agreed above chance on statement emotional valence (\(\kappa\) = 0.07,
\emph{p} \textless{} .001) and strength of relatedness (\(\kappa\) =
0.06, \emph{p} \textless{} .001).

\subsection{Selecting Statements for the Main
Experiment}\label{selecting-statements-e5a}

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tbl-candidate-statements}Statements with neutral average
emotional valence ratings.}

\centering{

\begin{tabular}[t]{rl}
\toprule
Item & Statement\\
\midrule
2 & As caffeine consumption increases, so does the average heart rate.\\
10 & Higher sugar consumption is associated with an increased risk of dental cavities.\\
16 & As the amount of sleep decreases, the risk of obesity increases.\\
22 & Higher consumption of spicy foods is associated with a lower risk of certain types of cancer.\\
23 & Greater adherence to a Mediterranean diet is linked to a lower risk of neurodegenerative diseases.\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

}

\end{table}%

Statements represents neutral emotional valence were selected to control
for the potential effects of statement emotionality in the main
experiment. Statements with average emotionality ratings between 3 and 5
are statements 2, 10, 22, 16, and 23, which can be seen in
Table~\ref{tbl-candidate-statements}. To ascertain which statements
represent the greatest consensus, standard deviations of ratings for
statement emotional valence and strength of relatedness were summed. Due
to concerns about experimental power, and in line with evidence that
propensity for belief change is highest when prior beliefs are not
strongly held \cite{xiong_2022, markant_2023}, at this point the
decision was made to test only the statement corresponding to weak
beliefs about the strength of relatedness between the variables in
question. Statement number 22 was therefore selected: ``Higher
consumption of spicy foods is associated with a lower risk of certain
types of cancer'', however the wording was modified such that the
variables (food consumption and cancer risk) are positively correlated.
While the work carried out in \chap{chap:adjusting_opacity},
\chap{chap:adjusting_size}, and \chap{chap:interactions_opacity_size}
show that opacity and size adjustments in scatterplots can affect
estimates of positive correlation, no work regarding the effects of
these manipulations in negatively correlated scatterplots has been
completed.

\subsection{Discussion}\label{discussion-e5a}

Fleiss' Kappa values for interrater agreement on both statement
emotional valence and strength of correlation scales are low (\(\kappa\)
= 0.07 and \(\kappa\) = 0.06 respectively), however do exceed that which
would be expected by chance. In light of this, decisions regarding which
statement to use are not based on the values of Fleiss' Kappa observed,
but rather on the standard deviations of ratings across all raters.
Statement emotionality and strength of relatedness are tested with
participants in the main study and included as fixed effects as part of
the analyses.

\section{Main Experiment: Alternative Scatterplot Designs and Beliefs
about Relatedness}\label{beliefs-main-e5}

The statement selected exhibits the lowest average level of belief about
strength of relatedness and the 2\textsuperscript{nd} highest level of
consensus. Modified for directionality, the statement reads:

\begin{quotation}
    ``Higher consumption of plain (non-spicy) foods
is associated with a higher risk of certain types of cancer.''
    
\end{quotation}

To maximise the likelihood of finding an effect of viewing alternative
scatterplots, the stimuli were designed based on a popular British news
source and the data were falsely credited as being supplied by the
British National Health Service (NHS). Participants were told that the
news source had requested their identity be obscured. They were
debriefed that this was not the case, and in fact the data were false,
at the end of the experiment. Based on evidence that beliefs can change
after viewing visualisations \cite{karduni_2020, markant_2023}, and that
scatterplots employing point opacity and size manipulations described in
\ref{related-work-beliefs} are able to affect perceptual estimates, the
following hypotheses were made:

\subsection{Hypotheses}\label{hypotheses-e5}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  H1: there will be a significant difference between ratings of strength
  of relatedness made before and after participants viewed scatterplots
  in either the standard or alternative conditions.
\item
  H2: this difference will be greatest when participants are exposed to
  scatterplots in the alternative scatterplot condition.
\end{itemize}

Exploratory investigations taking into account participants' scores on a
defensive confidence test, their scores on a graph literacy test, and
each participant's rating of the emotional valence of the correlative
statement used. Analysis including each of these factors can be found in
Section \ref{add-analyses-e5}, and their inclusion is justified below.

\subsubsection{Defensive Confidence}\label{def-con-e5}

In line with evidence that those who are more confident in their ability
to defend their own positions are more susceptible to having those
positions changed \cite{albarracin_2004}, participant's defensive
confidence was measured using Albarracín and Mitchell's
\cite{albarracin_2004} 12-item scale. This scale is replicated from
previous work in Appendix B, and has been utilised more recently
\cite{markant_2023} to explore the potential for attitude change
specifically with regard to correlations in scatterplots. Participants
provide answers to the 12 scale items using a 5-point Likert scale
anchored at points 1 (\emph{not at all characteristic of me}) and 5
(\emph{extremely characteristic of me}), with all other points being
unlabelled.

\subsubsection{Graph Literacy}\label{graph-literacy-e5}

No effect of graph literacy was found in experiments 1 to 4 (see
\chap{chap:adjusting_opacity}, \chap{chap:adjusting_size}, and
\chap{chap:interactions_opacity_size}). Despite this, the scale was
included here due to the higher predicted cognitive load of the current
tasks, along with evidence that graph literacy may affect performance on
more cognitively demanding visualisation tasks
\cite{canham_2010, okan_2012}. Additionally, the graph literacy test
used \cite{garcia_2016} is extremely short; in the present study, this
took participants an average of 27 seconds (\emph{SD} = 16 seconds).

\subsubsection{Emotionality}\label{emotionality}

The emotional content of a visualisation and the emotional state of a
participant may have cognitive and perceptual effects on performance in
visualisation tasks \cite{phelps_2006, harrison_2013, thoreson_2016};
this was the primary motivation behind performing the pre-study.
Nevertheless, it is not guaranteed that each participant considers the
emotional content of the correlative statement to be the same. To
account for these individual differences, ratings of emotional valence
are also collected during the main study.

\subsection{Method}\label{method-e5}

\subsubsection{Stimuli}\label{stimuli-e5}

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{7_belief_change_files/figure-latex/fig-exp5-examples-chap7-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-exp5-examples-chap7}Examples of the stimuli used in
experiment 4, demonstrated with an \textit{r} value of 0.6.}

\end{figure}%

After selecting a correlative statement describing a weak relationship
and with a high level of consensus between participants, the
\texttt{ggplot2} package (version 3.5.1) \cite{wickham_2016} was used to
create the stimuli for the main experiment. As the statement was rated
as describing a low level of relatedness, scatterplots describing a
strong relationship (0.6 \textless{} \emph{r} \textless{} 0.99) were
used with the intent of inducing belief change. Plots in the alternative
scatterplot condition were created using a combination of non-linear
opacity and size decay, as this particular condition was shown to bias
correlation estimates to a greater degree than either point opacity or
size decay alone (see experiment 4 in
\chap{chap:interactions_opacity_size}). 45 \emph{r} values uniformly
distributed between 0.6 and 0.99 were used to create 45 scatterplots for
each condition. Examples of stimuli using an \emph{r} value of 0.6 for
both the standard and alternative scatterplot conditions can be seen in
Figure~\ref{fig-exp5-examples-chap7}.

\subsubsection{Design}\label{design-e5}

Unlike all previous experiments, a between-participants design was
employed here. Each participant was randomly assigned either to group A,
in which they viewed standard scatterplots, or group B, in which they
viewed alternative scatterplots designed deliberately to elicit higher
levels of belief change. Participants saw all 45 experimental items for
their group, along with 4 attention check items, in a fully randomised
order. The dependent variable was the level of belief change induced by
viewing the scatterplot visualisations, so participants were tested on
how strongly related they believed the variables described by the
correlative statement were both \textbf{before} and \textbf{after}
viewing the experimental items. All experimental code, materials, and
instructions are hosted on GitLab as two separate experiments
\footnote{https://gitlab.pavlovia.org/Strain/atypical\_scatterplots\_main\_t}
\footnote{https://gitlab.pavlovia.org/Strain/atypical\_scatterplots\_main\_a}.

\subsubsection{Procedure}\label{procedure-e5}

Participants viewed the PIS and provided consent through key presses in
response to displayed consent statements. Participants were then asked
to provide their age and gender identity. Following this, participants
completed the 5-item Subjective Graph Literacy scale as in previous
experiments \cite{garcia_2016}, and Albarracín and Mitchell's
\cite{albarracin_2004} 12-item defensive confidence scale . To give
legitimacy to the data visualisations with hope of maximising any
potential belief change, participants were told that the graphs they
would see were taken from a well-known British news source, but that the
identity of this source had been obscured at their request. To promote
engagement with the visualisations, participants were instructed to use
a slider to estimate the correlation displayed in each scatterplot; no
hypotheses were made based on these data, and in the published paper
this chapter was based on, they were not analysed. For completeness
sake, I analyse this data in Section \ref{add-analyses-e5} here.
Following instructions, which included textual descriptions of
scatterplots and Pearson's \emph{r}, participants were given two
practice trials; these trials took the form of a typical ``standard
scatterplot'' trial from experiment 1. Participants were then asked to
indicate their beliefs about emotional valence and strength of
relatedness described in the chosen correlative statement; these data
were captured using Likert scales identical to those described
previously. After completing 45 experimental trials, participants were
then asked again, using the same Likert scales, to indicate their
beliefs about emotional valence and strength of relatedness.
Interspersed among the experimental items were four attention check
trials which explicitly asked participants to set the slider to 0 or 1.

\subsubsection{Participants}\label{participants-e5}

150 participants were recruited using the Prolific platform
\cite{prolific}. Normal to corrected-to-normal vision and English
fluency were required. As in the pre-study, UK residency was required of
participants, as the experiment relied on familiarity with the style of
a British news source. Participants who took part in the pre-study, or
in any of the experiments described in \chap{chap:adjusting_opacity},
\chap{chap:adjusting_size}, or \chap{chap:interactions_opacity_size}
were prevented from completing this experiment. Data were collected from
77 participants in each condition. 2 participants failed more than 2 out
of 4 attention check questions for each condition, meaning their data
were excluded per pre-registration stipulations. Data from the remaining
150 participants were included in the full analysis (48.67 male, 48.67
female, and 2.67 non-binary). Participants' mean age was 39.3 (\emph{SD}
= 11.5). Participants' mean graph literacy score was 21.3 (\emph{SD} =
4.3) out of 30, their mean defensive confidence score was 43 (\emph{SD}
= 6.8) out of 60, and their mean rating of statement emotional valence
was 2.9 (\emph{SD} = 1.3) on a 7-point Likert scale. On average,
participants took 14.2 minutes to complete the experiment (\emph{SD} =
6.41).
