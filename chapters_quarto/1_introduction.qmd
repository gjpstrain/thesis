Data visualisation is the practice of pictorially presenting patterns otherwise 
described by numbers, and has been employed in one form or another for thousands of
years \cite{azzam_2013}. Lists or matrices of numbers may be able to communicate
simple trends, but for more complex patterns, harnessing the human visual system
\cite{midway_2020} through visualisation is crucial for the communication of science
and data. Effective data visualisation is able to reduce cognitive and perceptual
loads on viewers, regardless of their backgrounds levels of statistical knowledge or 
experience. This outsourcing, while efficient, leaves the viewer vulnerable
to the design choices that were made when creating the visualisation. For this reason,
understanding *how* design choices affect interpretation is crucial to designing
better data visualisations and simultaneously allows for the inoculation of viewers against
poor or malevolent design practices.

One cannot understate the importance and ubiquity of data visualisations. 
They are used to communicate with experts, with those with no background
in science, and with everyone in between. They are relied upon to communicate vital
public health information \cite{li_2021}, to present evidence in court cases \cite{bobko_1979},
and to facilitate collaboration and encourage engagement on climate change issues
\cite{nocke_2008, schuster_2024}. Studying data visualisation therefore has the potential
to change the nature of scientific study itself.

Interaction with a data visualisation involves steps from perception (viewing),
to cognition (interpreting), to behaviour (deciding and acting). These stages must be 
examined both separately and together, as there are bottom-up and top-down
interactions present. In this thesis, I therefore present a series of
experiments whose aim was to investigate and address a long-standing
perceptual bias in scatterplots, a common form of 
data visualisation \cite{friendly_2005}. Following attempts to address this 
bias, I further investigated the impacts these attempts may have had on
cognition and behaviour.

# Research Motivation

Data visualisations were once the preserve of the academic and professional
classes. Now, however, visualisation is everywhere. This became especially
apparent to me during the COVID-19 pandemic, when people such as my parents, 
professionals with no background in mathematics or statistics, were
bombarded with data visualisations on a daily basis. Despite not being able
to fully articulate the whole data story, they were still able to derive
meaning from the visualisations they were seeing. The ability of data visualisations
to transcend language mathematical prowess motivated my study of them; concepts
such as exponential growth or the relatedness between variables can be displayed
in simple ways that do not rely on an underlying understanding of exponents
or correlation coefficients.

Using data visualisations in such a way effectively provides a cognitive proxy
for viewers. This is an efficient way to communicate, however still necessitates
the presence of accurate and reliable perceptions. On further investigation
into the reliance that those who design visualisations make on those who view
them, I uncovered a historic perceptual bias that was still being described
in the literature, seemingly with no attempt at correction. This bias
was the underestimation of correlation in positively correlated scatterplots.
In the literature, this robust effect had been observed in a number of experimental
paradigms, including direct estimation \cite{strahan_1978, bobko_1979, cleveland_1982,
collyer_1990, lane_1985, lauer_1989, meyer_1997} and estimation via bisection tasks
\cite{rensink_2017}, and as of 2021, no attempts had been made to correct for it.
The goal of this thesis was therefore to collect empirical evidence on the perception
of correlation in positively correlated scatterplots, to use that information to 
create novel visualisations with a view to correcting for the underestimation,
and to further investigate the potential for these visualisations to effect 
what people think and believe.

# Contributions {#contributions-introduction}

Through this thesis, I present a series of empirical experiments that provide
knowledge about how changing visual features in scatterplots can affect how participants
interpret the strength of the correlation displayed. I demonstrate that systematically
reducing the opacities and sizes of points on scatterplots as a function of their
distances from a regression line can significantly increase estimates of correlation
and partially correct for a historic underestimation bias. Following this, I show 
that consequences of employing these techniques are not limited to perception, but
in fact can be extended into a cognitive space to change what people think and believe.
I utilise large-sample, controlled experiments with lay populations to provide
generalisable conclusions and recommendations for visualisation designers and 
researchers. Through this thesis, I provide a framework for the large-scale
testing of data visualisations with lay audiences. Additionally, I hope to provide
an example of a project conducted entirely in an open and reproducible manner.

# Overview of Thesis

In Chapter 2, I conduct a thorough review of the literature and provide the necessary
context for the following experimental chapters. I begin by exploring the history 
and significance of data visualisation, before discussing concepts of correlation
and relatedness, and their visualisation using scatterplots. I discuss a long-standing
perceptual bias in the interpretation of correlation in scatterplots, and thereby 
motivate novel experimental work that seeks to address this bias. I provide
real-world motivation by exploring the potential for perceptual biases to have effects
on people's lives and livelihoods. Finally, I provide a discussion on issues of 
graph and statistical literacy.

Chapter 3 explores the general methodological approaches taken by this thesis, with
a particular focus on transparency and reproducibility. This thesis embodies these
principles, and justification for them along practical and pedagogical lines is presented.
This Chapter also contains detailed instructions for the full reproduction of this
thesis, and provides context for the approaches to experimental design, recruitment,
and analysis featured in the following chapters.

Chapter 4 presents a pair of experiments that establish the effects of point opacity
on correlation perception in positively correlated scatterplots. The first experiment
demonstrates that lowering point opacity in a uniform manner can increase participants'
levels of error on a correlation estimation task. The second experiment describes
how employing a function relating point opacity to residual error can correct
for the correlation underestimation bias by shifting estimates upwards. Specifically,
lowering point contrast as a function of residual error provides significant
levels of correction for the underestimation bias, and demonstrates that, in contrast
to previous work, changing visual features can alter perceptions of correlation. 
This finding was foundational for the remainder of the work described in this thesis. 
This Chapter also includes a discussion of a very early pilot study; I describe why
this experiment was not included in published work, and offer reflections on what
I learnt from conducting it in Section \ref{pilot-study}.

In Chapter 5, I present an experiment that expands the technique described in the
previous chapter to point size. I show that reducing the sizes of scatterplot
points as a function of residual error is able to alter participants'
estimates of correlation to a greater degree than functions relating point opacity
and residual error. 

Chapter 6 describes an experiment in which point opacity and size adjustments
are combined. This experiment includes conditions in which point opacity and size
are reduced and increased together with residual error (congruent conditions),
and conditions in which one increases while another decreases (incongruent conditions).
I demonstrate that opacity and size adjustments interact in a non-linear fashion,
and explore the potential for further tuning of these manipulations to create
perceptually optimised scatterplots.

In Chapter 7, I extend the perceptual effects described in previous chapters to
a cognitive space. In a single experiment, I explore the potential for scatterplots
using point opacity and size manipulations to change participants' beliefs about 
levels of relatedness between variables. I show that using such manipulations is able
to change beliefs to a significantly greater degree compared to standard, unaltered
scatterplots. This Chapter also describes a pre-study that explores thoughts and 
feelings about relatedness to ascertain a variable pair that is particularly 
vulnerable to belief-change. The main experiment demonstrates that visual features
can not only affect perceptions of correlation, but can also affect beliefs.

Chapter 8 presents a synthesis of the empirical work described in this thesis. I 
present discussions of the theoretical and practical implications of my findings,
along with an exploration of future directions that my work could inform.
