Data visualisation is the practice of pictorially presenting patterns otherwise 
described by numbers, and has been employed in one form or another for thousands of
years \cite{azzam_2013}. Lists or matrices of numbers may be able to communicate
simple trends, but for more complex patterns, harnessing the human visual system
\cite{midway_2020} through visualisation is crucial for the communication of science
and data. Effective data visualisation is able to reduce cognitive and perceptual
loads on viewers, regardless of their backgrounds levels of statistical knowledge or 
experience. This outsourcing, while efficient, leaves the viewer vulnerable
to the design choices that were made when creating the visualisation. For this reason,
understanding *how* design choices affect interpretation is crucial to designing
better data visualisations and simultaneously allows for the inoculation of viewers against
poor or malevolent design practices.

One cannot understate the importance and ubiquity of data visualisations. 
They are used in to communicate with experts, with those with no background
in science, and with everyone in between. They are relied upon to communicate vital
public health information \cite{li_2021}, to present evidence in court cases \cite{bobko_1979},
and to facilitate collaboration and encourage engagement on climate change issues
\cite{nocke_2008, schuster_2024}. Studying data visualisation therefore has the potential
to change the nature of scientific study itself.

Interaction with a data visualisation involves steps from perception (viewing),
to cognition (interpreting), to behaviour (deciding and acting). These stages must be 
examined both separately and together, as there are bottom-up and top-down
interactions present. In this thesis, I therefore present a series of
experiments whose aim was to investigate and address a long-standing
perceptual bias in scatterplots, a very common form of 
data visualisation \cite{friendly_2005}. Following attempts to address this 
bias, I further investigated the impacts these attempts may have had on
cognition and behaviour.

# Research Motivation

Data visualisations were once the preserve of the academic and professional
classes. Now, however, visualisation is everywhere. This became especially
apparent to me during the COVID-19 pandemic, when people such as my parents, 
professionals with no background in mathematics or statistics, were
bombarded with data visualisations on a daily basis. Despite not being able
to fully articulate the whole data story, they were still able to derive
meaning from the visualisations they were seeing. The ability of data visualisations
to transcend language and even mathematical ability motivated my study of them; concepts
such as exponential growth or the relatedness between variables can be displayed
in simple ways that do not rely on underlying understanding of exponents
or correlation coefficients.

Using data visualisations in such a way effectively provides a cognitive proxy
for viewers. This is an efficient way to communicate, however still necessitates
the presence of accurate and reliable perception. On further investigation
into the reliance that those who design visualisations make on those who view
them, I uncovered a historic perceptual bias that was still being described
in the literature, seemingly with no attempt at correction. This bias
was the underestimation of correlation in positively correlated scatterplots.



Interaction with data visualisation is an inherently complex process. One
of the (many) advantages of visualising data is that one can communicate
a range of statistics and interpretations simultaneously.
