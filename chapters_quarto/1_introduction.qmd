# Research Motivation

# Contributions {#contributions-introduction}

# Included Publications

The research described in chapters 4, 5, 6, and 7 in this thesis is adapted from
earlier publications, the last of which under review as of writing. To avoid repetition,
information and discussion that would be repeated has been consolidated into the
literature review and general methodology chapters. *Gabriel Strain* is the primary
author of all included papers.

 - *The Effects of Contrast on Correlation Perception in Scatterplots* \cite{strain_2023} is reproduced
 in \chap{chap:adjusting_opacity}. Sections \ref{methods-adjusting-opacity-e1}, 
 \ref{methods-adjusting-opacity-e2}, \ref{analysis-adjusting-opacity-e1},
 \ref{analysis-adjusting-opacity-e2}, \ref{discussion-adjusting-opacity-e1}, 
 \ref{discussion-adjusting-opacity-e2}, and\ref{general-discussion-adjusting-opacity}
 contain minimally altered parts of the published article.
 
 - *Adjusting Point Size to Facilitate More Accurate Correlation Perception in Scatterplots*
 \cite{strain_2023b} is reproduced in \chap{chap:adjusting_size}. Sections 
 \ref{methods-adjusting-size}, \ref{analysis-adjusting-size}, \ref{discussion-adjusting-size},
 and \ref{general-discussion-adjusting-size} contain minimally altered parts of 
 the published article.
 
 - *Effects of Point Size and Opacity Adjustments in Scatterplots* \cite{strain_2024}
 is reproduced in \chap{chap:interactions_opacity_size}. Sections \ref{methods-interactions},
 \ref{analysis-interactions}, \ref{discussion-interactions}, and \ref{general-discussion-interactions}
 contain minimally altered parts of the published article.
 
 - *Effects of Alternative Scatterplot Designs on Belief* (*under review*) is 
 reproduced in \chap{chap:belief_change}. Sections \ref{beliefs-pre-study},
 \ref{methods-beliefs-main}, \ref{analysis-beliefs-main}, \ref{discussion-beliefs-main},
 and \ref{general-discussion-beliefs} contain minimally altered parts of the published article.
