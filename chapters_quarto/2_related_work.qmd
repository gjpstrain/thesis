# Data Visualisation: A Brief History {#brief-history}

Data visualisation, which can be thought of as the practice of representing information 
in a visual modality \cite{hinterberger_2009}, is difficult to concretely define,
classify, and categorise. With the primacy of vision with regards to our interactions with
and interpretations of the world around us, data visualisation may be thought of
as an extension of art and the written word. Both art and writing are ancient 
phenomena, with evidence for the former being found in the prehistoric
period some 66,000 years ago \cite{standish_2025}, and evidence for the latter
emerging as Mesopotamian cuneiform around 3200 B.C.E \cite{schmandt_2014}.
Broadly, the literature agrees that art emerged prior to the written word; 
this speaks volumes of the human instinct to represent our thoughts, feelings,
emotions, and that which we interact with in the world around us pictorially.
This instinct has not waned, and modern computing makes it easier than ever for
those of us with no technical or artistic skills to create graphics and visualisations
that *tell stories* about our data in ways which are both beautiful and practical.

When, then, should we consider to be the emergence of data visualisation as a 
human practice? Of course, answering this question requires the provision of a 
definition for the practice itself first. Schmandt-Besserat \cite{schmandt_1978, schmandt_2014}
considers clay counting tokens to be the direct precursor of the written word.
While the evidence for this link is controversial \cite{robson_2007}, the existence of such
tokens is not. With each shape of token representing a certain amount of a 
certain good (measures of grain, jars of oil, etc.), this system could be considered
a very early, very simple form of data visualisation (or physicalisation
\cite{jansen_2015}). Similarly, there is limited evidence of prehistoric cartographic
drawings \cite{muhly_1978}, which may also be considered
a form of, or related to, data visualisation. While I am not asserting
that data visualisation is older than writing, or that ancient map drawings are
equivalent to modern graphics, the existence of these representations emphasises the 
attractive convenience that symbols and signs represent for humans; making sense
of our world and the relationships therein is often easier through pictures as
opposed to words and numbers, a principle which I consider key for this thesis.

Note: much of the rest of this section is heavily inspired by Michael Friendly's
*A Brief History of Data Visualization* \cite{friendly_2008}.

Moving on, then, to the kind of pictorial representation that modern students and scientists would 
firmly recognise as a "data visualisation". Tufte and Graves-Morris, in 1983's
seminal *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information* \cite{tufte_1983}, describe
an unattributed time series illustration from the 10th or 11th century, itself
described by Funkhouser in 1936 \cite{funkhouser_1936} as being discovered by
Sigmund Günther in 1877. This illustration is included here in @fig-early-time-series.

This purports to show the movements of planetary bodies as a function of time,
although Funkhouser considered it little more than a "schematic diagram...for
illustrative purposes" \cite{funkhouser_1936}. Regardless, the recognisable
grid lines and sinusoidal variation in the curves are ideas that would not appear
again for another 600-700 years, after which they would become mainstays of 
visualisation. In the mid-14th century, French philosopher Nicole
Oresme demonstrated an understanding of graphing by plotting proto-bar charts,
and by the 16th century, advances in cartography, photography, and mathematics
laid the ground for an explosion in data visualisation.

The 17th century saw the birth of geometry and coordinate systems, error measurement,
probability, and demographic statistics. With these scientific advancements
came the advancements in data visualisation needed to communicate these concepts.
For example, in 1626, Scheiner used what Tufte would later term the "principle of small multiples"
\cite{tufte_1983} to illustrate how configurations of sunspots change over time
(see @fig-sunspots).

The temperature scale on the lower portion of the graph illustrates the weather conditions during the retreat, with a freezing Russian winter causing high rates of attrition.

The latter half of the 19th century, the so-called "Golden Age of Statistical Graphics"
\cite{friendly_2008} saw the rise of forms of data visualisation that begin 
to look remarkably similar to the graphs and informatics seen in mass media and
scientific publications today. The most notable examples of these are John Snow's cholera map, which
was able to link the incidence of cholera to a contaminated water pump in London
(@fig-cholera), Charles Joseph Minard's flow chart of the Napoleonic invasion of Russia
(@fig-napoleon), and Florence Nightingale's rose diagrams (polar area charts in
the modern parlance, see @fig-nightingale). In each of these graphs, visualisation
is used with different intent. In John Snow's cholera map, visualisation was used
to track cases of a deadly disease, and facilitated a novel linkage between cholera
and contaminated drinking water. In Charles Joseph Minard's flow chart of Napoleon's
failed 1812 invasion of Russia, a total of six variables are displayed to tell the
data story, allowing the viewer to appreciate the movements of the Grande Armée,
it's diminishing size owing to attrition, and the freezing temperatures that
largely caused that attrition. Florence Nightingale's polar area chart depicts
the causes of mortality amongst British troops in the Crimean War; charts such as
this were used to successfully campaign for better sanitation in hospitals and
the front lines.

In all of these visualisations, data is used to accentuate storytelling. In some
cases, this may lead to critical discoveries that save lives, and in others, it
may simply facilitate a greater understanding and appreciation of the data. In either
case, visualisation is used effectively to appeal to our affinity for visual
storytelling.

An appetite for precision defined the approach to statistical thinking, and by
extension, data visualisation, in the first half of the 20th century. Statistical
graphics finally became mainstream, and were implemented in curricula, and used
in government, commerce, and finance. This period also marks the beginning of 
graphical methods being used to generate new scientific insights, a trend which
would only accelerate throughout the next century. The most prominent example of this
is Henry Moseley's (1913) discovery of the concept of atomic number \cite{moseley_1913},
which I will discuss in greater detail in Section \ref{history-corr-viz}.

Significant developments in the latter half of the 20th century laid the final
brick in the foundations of what would become the modern data visualisation 
landscape. John W. Tukey's *The Future of Data Analysis* \cite{tukey_1962} proposed
a separation between data analysis and mathematical statistics. This seminal work
would become hugely influential, and Tukey would go on to invent a great number of
analysis-driven data visualisations, including stem-leaf plots and box plots, both
of which are now commonplace in software packages and statistics education. In 1967, Jacques
Bertin \cite{bertin_1967} published *Sémiologie graphique* 
(*Semiology of Graphics*), organising the perceptual elements of data visualisations
according to their features and their relationships to the underlying data; this work
would be influential for Leland Wilkinson's *Grammar of Graphics* \cite{wilkinson_1999},
which in turn influenced the `ggplot2` package \cite{wickham_2016} that is used
extensively in this paper.
